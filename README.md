# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a major financial issue, and the goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

The dataset used is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions represent a very small percentage of total transactions. Various data preprocessing and modeling techniques are applied to handle this challenge effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze and preprocess credit card transaction data
* Handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection
* Compare model performance using relevant metrics

---

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions
* Features are numerical and obtained through PCA transformation
* The target variable indicates whether a transaction is **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**

> ⚠️ Due to privacy concerns, original feature names are not available.
